# Gambit
[![Build](../../actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/build.yml)

Gambit is a robotic chess board that employs magnetism for piece movement and movement detection. It utilizes an electromagnet on an H-Bot mechanism for precise piece manipulation and a reed switch matrix to accurately track piece positions. The core of Gambit is powered by an Arduino Nano ESP32 and is primarily constructed using 3D printing.

The Arduino Nano ESP32 opens up possibilities for future enhancements, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. These features enable connections to powerful chess engines and allow for game recording capabilities through a companion app.
